Among the different techniques that are used by scholars to challenge the physical science issues, the statistical learning techniques seems to provide a promising approach to challenge them [1]. This approach can be used to tackle, one of the oldest problem of physical sciences:  the habitability of the exoplanets and the possibility of the presence of life on them [2]. This approach was previously used by different scholars [3]: here a group of statistical learning techniques (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support-vector machines and Quadratic Discriminat analysis) were applied and compared.
